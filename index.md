## Welcome to My GitHub Page!

My name is Franky Pan, and I am a recent graduate from Stony Brook University! I am looking for new and exciting opportunites in software engineering and web development. You can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frpan/) or email (frpan814@gmail.com)! 

### [College 4 Me (c4me) Project](https://github.com/frpansbu/c4me-FASS)

My last year in college focused on web development and I've come to really enjoy it! My last semester involved working in a team of three others [Amta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amta-sulaiman-983b0685), [Shawn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnfelix) and [Sean](https://www.facebook.com/seancspencer).
Simply put, it's a website that helps high school students look for colleges that are right for them using a filtering search system and recommendation score algorithm! 
Students can search for colleges, compare themselves to other students who have applied, and look at in depth info on colleges. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/frpansbu/c4me-FASS) for more info, or click the heading to check it out yourself!
